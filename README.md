back-end of MySQL for the DB content. **BlizzLikeCore** is an individual project 
based on the code of [CMaNGOS](http://cmangos.net/ "CMaNGOS") and 
[ScriptDev2](http://www.scriptdev2.com/ "SD2") with extensive changes over time 
to optimize, improve and cleanup the codebase at the same time as improving the 
ingame mechanics and functionality.
